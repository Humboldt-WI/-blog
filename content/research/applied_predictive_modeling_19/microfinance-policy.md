# Microfinance Policies <br/> Impact of Microfinance on The Social Well-being

#### Authors: Edanur Kahvecioglu and Yu-Tang Wu

## Abstract

Is microcredit a miracle or just a hype? While more and more
researches were conducted to study microcredits, people started to
question the effectiveness of microcredit program. This project
explores the heterogeneity of treatment effect on microcredit to
households' well-being. Causuall Random Forest and Two-model approach
are used to analyze treatment effects on the household level and
identify the important variables that separate households with higher
treatment effect. The results show evidence of heterogeneity of the
conditional treatment effect on certain aspects of well-being. In
addition, policy suggestions are proposed to attempt to increase the
performance of microfinance program.

## Motivation

Microfinance is a type of credit provided to unemployed or low-income
individuals or groups who are deprived of having access to
conventional financial services. Although it is not a new concept in
human history, as a first organization, Grameen Bank was established
in 1976 by Muhammad Yunus in Bangladesh. It provided small loans to
the poor without requiring collateral. The idea was very promising and
it even brought Yunus a Nobel Prize. However, since the 2010 Indian
Microfinance crisis, its effectiveness is in doubt and being discussed
([Mader 2013](#mader2013RiseFallMicrofinance)).  According to Banerjee
et al. (2015) though, microcredit institutions have been effective for
business and social well-being to a certain extent. For the assessment
of the impact of microcredit institutions in the treated area, they
used OLS regressions with area-level control variables and the
indicator for living in a treated area. 

$$y_{ia}=\alpha+\beta*Treat _{ia}+X _{\alpha} '\gamma +\epsilon _{ia}$$

However, usage of OLS arose two backlashes which this paper tries to
challenge.

First, it assumes if there is a statistically significant on an
indicator, which happened after the experiment being carried out, then
the change must be a result of the treatment. However, it fails to
distinguish people who would have increased or decreased their
well-being regardless of the treatment, in this case, the introduction
of microcredit institutions. 

Second, it calculates average treatment effects in the area which is
the difference in average outcomes between areas assigned to the
treatment and areas assigned to the control. By calculating the
average effect, it fails to capture the subgroup in the area which
caused the major difference among the ones who may not have been
affected by the treatment. Heterogeneous treatment effect, on the
other hand, could have been useful to differ the subgroups which are
affected most from the least. 

In this paper, the dataset from ([Banerjee
et. al. 2015](#banerjee2015miraclemicrofinanceevidence)) has been used
in several uplift models to capture the heterogeneous treatment effect
of easy access to microcredit in the treated areas. By doing so, it is
aimed to find the most affected subgroups from the treatment and to
come up with policy suggestions for the microfinance institutions
accordingly.

## Introduction

Since the dataset from ([Banerjee
et. al. 2015](#banerjee2015miraclemicrofinanceevidence)) paper is
used, it was important to understand how the data is collected and the
experiment is pursued.

The paper ([Banerjee
et al. 2015](#banerjee2015MiracleMicrofinanceEvidence)) presents the
results from the randomized evaluation of a group-lending microcredit
program in Hyderabad, India. Microcredit has been lent to groups of 6
to 10 women by a microfinance institution, Spandana. According to the
baseline survey conducted in 2005, 104 neighborhoods with no
pre-existing microfinance was selected. They were paired up and one of
each pair was randomly assigned to the treatment group. Spandana then
progressively began operating in the 52 treatment areas between 2006
and 2007. As an important point to highlight, the treatment was not a
credit take-up but an easy access to microcredit. 

This first endline survey was conducted at least 12 months after
Spandana began operating within a given area, and generally 15 to 18
months after, which corresponds to the dates 2007 and 2008. Two years
later, in 2009–2010, a second endline survey, following up on the same
households, was undertaken. In the surveys, the questions related to
the households’ business, consumption, and credit situation as well as
their fixed characteristics and social well-being. Besides, they
calculated index variables from the related variables, which are used
in our analysis. 

### Why Index Variables

Instead of analyzing specific household behaviors such as business
investment or consumption of nondurable goods, as the original paper
did, we want to focus on the more general aspect of the
well-being. This could be done by utilizing the “Index” variables
provided by the dataset. 

These index variables are the weighted average of related
variables. For example, business index is the weighted average of
business asset, business expenses, business profit etc. By doing so,
the index variable become a holistic representation of an aspect of
well-being and can capture general condition of that aspect. In the
example above, business index could represent the overall
circumstances of the business activities of the households.

## Dataset

The paper comes with 5 datasets ([Banerjee et
al. 2015](#banerjee2015MiracleMicrofinanceEvidence)), including data
gathered in the first endline survey and the second endline survey as
well as data gathered in the baseline survey. 

This project uses mainly the endline dataset, specifically the first
endline data, for analysis. The baseline dataset would be useful to
calculate the changes across time. However, in our case, the index of
households is different between baseline dataset and endline
dataset. Hence we can not make one-to-one mapping between households
in the two datasets. And since we are mainly interested in how easy
accessibility to Spandana microcredits affect households’ well-being,
only the data collected in the first endline survey will be used in
this project.

After cleaning up, the dataset contains 6036 households which
completed the first endline survey and 54 variables, which contains
the information of a household’s basic properties (the household size
`hhsize_adj_1`, how old is the household head `head_age_1`), their
financial/loans status (whether they took loans `anyloan_1`, how many
bank loan they took `bank_amt_1`), their businesses status if any
(profits `bizprofit_1`, assets `bizassets_1`), their monthly
expenditures on various types of good (expenditure on nondurable goods
per capita `nondurable_exp_mo_pc_1`), and the calculated index
variables.   

## Methods

While deciding on the methods, we pay attention to pick uplift models
in order to capture incremental impact of the treatment, by which we
could separate the responded group because of the treatment and the
responded group which would have responded anyway.

We picked 2 models:

- Causal Random Forest
- Two-model Approach

### Structure of Analysis

This section describes the general structure of the analysis and the
methods used for each task. The details of each method will be
discussed in the next section. 

1. Detect whether the treatment effect on the selected index variable
   exhibits heterogeneity. 

    This is vital as our "welfare-enhancing policies" is based on the
    assumption of targeting only the households with relatively large
    treatment effect. Hence if the treatment effect is homogeneous,
    which means all households exhibit similar treatment effect, then
    the targeting policies would be inefficient.  To perform this
    task, Two-model Approach with Sorted Groups Average Treatment
    Effect (GATES), which was proposed by Chernozhukov ([Chernozhukov
    et al. 2018)](#chernozhukov2018GenericMachineLearning)), will be
    used. 

2. Find the variables that separate households with higher treatment
   effect. 

    If the treatment effect is heterogeneous, next thing to do is to
    try to separate those high treatment effect households.  For this
    task we will use to methods, Causal Random Forest and Two-model
    Approach with Random Forest. 

    1. Causal Forest: The Signiﬁcance-Based Splitting Criterion

        The causal forest’s splitting rule builds trees and mimics the
        process that would be used if the treatment eﬀects were
        observed ([Hitsch & Misra
        2008](#hitsch2018HeterogeneousTreatmentEffects)). 

    2. Two-Model Approach

        There is no conventional way to get variable importance using
        Two-Model Approach. However, given the predicted conditional
        treatment effect by Two-model approach we could further fit a
        Random Forest model to get the variable importance. 

3. Find the thresholds for given variables that could make the
   policies more performing.  
   
    Narrowing the target could make the policy more efficient and
   better performing. Hence after knowing which variables make the
   highest impact on households’ treatment effect, our next step is
   then to investigate at which values of those variables a household
   could benefit the most from the treatment.   
   
    To accomplish this, we will first check if there is a pattern of
   how the target feature affect the conditional treatment effect and
   then use partial dependence plots to find the critical thresholds.

### Two-model Approach And GATES

Two-model approach was proposed by Chernozhukov et al. as a method for
estimating average treatment effects ([Chernozhukov et
al. 2016](#chernozhukov2016DoubleDebiasedMachine),[Chernozhukov et
al. 2017](#chernozhukov2017DoubleDebiasedNeyman)). The concept is
fairly straightforward. Since machine learning has been shown to be
highly effective in prediction, two-model approach exploits this
feature by fitting two independent models, one estimating treatment
effect in the control group and the other in the treatment group. This
way we obtain one model that could be used to predict the “baseline”
outcome, which is defined as the outcomes if the subjects were not
treated, and the other model that could be used to predict the
outcomes if they were treated. Then individual’s conditional treatment
effect is the difference between the predicted baseline outcome and
the predicted treated outcome. 

The main advantages of two-model approach are its simplicity and easy
to implement. It requires no additional methods and is generic to
machine learning algorithms. 

Sorted group average treatment effect was also proposed by
Chernozhukov et al. (2018) as one of the strategies to estimate and
make inferences on key features of heterogeneous treatment
effects. ([Chernozhukov et
al. 2018](#chernozhukov2018GenericMachineLearning)). GATES first sorts
and groups subjects based on their predicted conditional treatment
effect (as a convention, group #1 should contain subjects with lower
predicted conditional treatment effect and group #5 should contain
subjects with higher predicted conditional treatment effect.) Then use
a weighted OLS 

$$Y=\alpha'X_1\sum_k^K\gamma_k*(D-p(X))*1(G_k)+v$$

to test whether the average treatment effect differ between groups (
$\gamma_k$ significantly different for some k). 

The disadvantages of GATES are that (i) it can not assign individual
into a specific group. As it is recommended to execute the procedure
multiple times to eliminate sampling error, a given household might be
assigned to different groups in each iteration. This therefore makes
it difficult to assign a household into a specific group. (ii) it can
not detect homogeneity. Jacob et al. suggested that GATES has
difficulty detecting homogeneous treatment effect ([Jacob et
al.](#jacobCausalInferenceUsing)). They showed that GATES still
indicates heterogeneity, when feeding the simulated data with
homogeneous treatment effect. 

### Causal Random Forest

Causal random forest is a method for nonparametric statistical
estimation based on random forests ([Wager and Athey
2018](#wager2018EstimationInferenceHeterogeneous)), in which the
criteria used for choosing each split during the growth phase of
random forest trades off two desirable properties:

- maximization of the difference in outcome between the two subpopulations;
- minimization of the difference in size between them. ([Radcliffe
  et. al. 2011](#radcliffe2011RealWorldUpliftModelling))

At the end, the count of splits which the variable caused and at which
value reveals the most important variables and its most significant
value.


## Results

### Business Index

The first index variable we choose is business index for the reason
that we believe boosting business activities is a more direct way to
stimulate economic growth.  

Studies suggested that small businesses are significant contributors
to economic development, job creation, and general welfare ([Morrison
et al. 2003](#morrison2003SmallBusinessGrowth)) meanwhile
entrepreneurial activity plays an important role in economic growth
([Stel et al. 2005](#stel2005EffectEntrepreneurialActivity)). In
addition, according to Spandana’s initial goal of the experiment, the
microcredit program was aimed to provide a better environment for
women in Hyderabad to create their own small businesses. Hence
business index was chosen to be our first target to analyze.  

Not all the households being surveyed own businesses. Hence when
analyzing business index, the households without any business (in the
past or at the time) were excluded.  

As business index is the weighted average of business related
variables (business assets, profit etc), it is highly correlated to
those variables. For this reason, all those business related variables
were excluded from the dataset. The other index variables
(`women_emp_index_1`, `social_index_1`) were also removed in order to
prevent confusing results as they are just the weighted average of a
set of variables already included in the dataset.  

```{r biz_dataset}
target_index <- "biz_index_all_1"

endline1_biz <- endline1 %>%
  filter(total_biz_1 != 0) %>%  # filter only the household with a least on business
  select(everything(),
         -hhid,
         -contains("biz"),   # exclude business related variables
         -contains("index"), # exclude all index variables
         target_index)       # add back the target index variable
```

1. Heterogeneity of Treament Effect on Business Index

    We use GATES with 5 groups ($k$ equals to 5), the same number as
    Chernozhukov et al. (2018) used in their paper. 

    ![GATES Business
    Index](/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/biz_gates-1.png) 

    *Figure5-2-1: Sorted Groups Average Treatment Effects for Business
    Index*
    
    The result shows that while the average treatment effect for all
    households is close to zero, there are signs of heterogeneity, at
    least for the fifth and the first group. This supports our
    hypothesis that the treatment effect is different for different
    groups of households. In addition, the result concludes that about
    half of the households have negative treatment effect, which might
    lead to the conditional treatment effect being close to zero on
    average.  

    In spite of the treatment being ineffective on average, the
    microfinance program could still make great impacts if the policy
    targets only the households that have positive treatment effect.

2. The Groups Separating Variables

    ![The Group Separating
    Variables](/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/biz_varimp-1.png)
    
    *Figure5-1-2: left: Variable Importance predicted by Causal Random
    Forest; right: Vriable Importance predicted by Two-model Approach*

    Based on the results of the two methods, we can see that
    `food_exp_mo_pc_1`, the household’s monthly expenditures on food
    per household member, `health_exp_mo_pc_1`, the household’s
    monthly health related expenditures per household member,
    `hhsize_adj_1`, the adjusted household size, `informal_amt_1`, the
    amount of informal loans a household has, are among the most
    important features that could determine how the treatment affects
    a household’s business situation.

    One interesting thing to notice is that expenses related variables
    dominates the results as most of them are highly important to
    separate households with high treatment effect. We could directly
    concludes from the result that household expenditures are
    important factors that determine the effectiveness of our
    treatment. However, the problem is that the relationship of
    expenditures and the success of business makes it difficult to
    exclude the possibility of endogeneity issue. Does the amount of
    expenditures affect how well the business improve from the
    treatment or are the changes in expenditures the results of
    changes in business status? In this case, the two effects needed
    to be separated in order to get reasonable inferences. 

    There are ways to deal with issues of endogeneity. One well known
    method is to construct instrumental variables to mitigate the
    problem. However, as a well defined instrumental variable could 
    not be found in the dataset, this method could not be applied in
    this case. The viable albeit imperfect option left is to just
    delete those expenditures related variables. Hence for the
    following analysis, the dataset with expenditure variables
    (`nondurable_exp_mo_pc_1`, `health_exp_mo_pc_1` etc) excluded will
    be used. 

### Business Index Without Expenditures Variables

```{r biz_dataset_without_exp}
target_index <- "biz_index_all_1"

endline1_biz_noexp <- endline1 %>%
  filter(total_biz_1 != 0) %>%  # filter only the household with a least on business
  select(everything(),
         -hhid,
         -contains("biz"),   # exclude business related variables
         -contains("exp"),   # exclude expenditures related variables
         -contains("index"), # exclude all index variables
         target_index)       # add back the target index variable
```

1. Heterogeneity of Treament Effect on Business Index

    ![GATES Business Index Without Expenditures
    Variables](/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/biz_noexp_gates-1.png)
    
    *Figure5-2-1: Sorted Groups Average Treatment Effects for Business
    Index without expenditures variables*
    
    The result is similar to the above one (Business Index with
    expenditure covariates).

2. The Groups Separating Variables

    ![The Group Separating
    Variables](/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/biz_noexp_varimp-1.png)
    
    *Figure5-2-2: left: Variable Importance predicted by Causal Random
    Forest; right: Vriable Importance predicted by Two-model Approach*
    
    After we exclude expenditure related variables, the results of the
    two methods are more aligned and the most important variables then
    become “The Amount of Informal Loans”, “Adjusted Household Size”
    and “Head Age”. In the following section we will discuss and try
    to find the optimum value for each feature. 

3. Amount of Informal Loans

    ![Scatter Plot
    informal_amt_1](/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/biz_noexp_trend_informal_amt-1.png)  
    
    *Figure5-2-3: Scatter Plot of Amount of Informal Loans to
    Predicted Conditional Treatment Effect* 
    
    Based on the result of Causal Random Forest, we can see that there
    is no general pattern of how the amount of informal loans affect
    the predicted treatment effect. However, the result of Two-model
    Approach shows a slight trend that increasing the amount of
    informal loan will decrease the treatment effect. 
    
    ![Partial Dependence Plot
    informal_amt_1](/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/biz_noexp_pdp_informal_amt-1.png)  
    
    *Figure5-2-4: Partial Dependence Plot of Amount of Informal Loans
    to Conditional Treatment Effect*
    
    Next, the partial dependence plots is used to find the critical
    values that lead to higher treatment effect. This time, both
    models predict that households with larger amount of informal
    loans tend to have lower treatment effect. And the optimal amount
    of informal loans should be close to zero. 
    
4. Adjusted Household Size
  
    ![Scatter Plot
    hhsize_adj_1](/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/biz_noexp_trend_hhsize_adj-1.png)  
    
    *Figure5-2-5: Scatter Plot of Adjusted Household Size to
    Conditional Treatment Effect*
    
    We can see that while Causal Random Forest predicts no clear
    pattern of how adjusted household size affect conditional
    treatment effect. On the other hand, Two-model Approach indicates
    that households with adjusted household size being around 5-6 have
    relatively higher treatment effect.
    
    ![Partial Dependence Plot
    hhsize_adj_1](/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/biz_noexp_pdp_hhsize_adj-1.png)  
    
    *Figure5-2-6: Partial Dependence Plot of Adjusted Household Size
    to Conditional Treatment Effect*
    
    The partial dependence plots reflect the above results. Causal
    Random Forest tells us that once the adjusted household size is
    above 4, the conditional treatment effects become relatively
    stable. On the other side, Two-model Approach implies that there
    exists an optimal adjusted household size, which is around
    4-5. And once the adjusted household size passes the threshold,
    the treatment effect starts to diminish. 
    
5. Head Age
  
    ![Scatter Plot
    head_age](/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/biz_noexp_trend_head_age-1.png)  
    
    *Figure5-2-7: Scatter Plot of Head Age to Conditional Treatment
    Effect*
    
    In the case of head age, the two methods suggest slightly
    different results. From the scatter plot, Causal Random Forest
    shows almost negligible pattern that increasing the head age
    increases the treatment effect. Yet Two-model Approach shows that
    as the head age increases, the treatment effect will first
    increase then decrease. 

    ![Partial Dependence Plot
    head_age](/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/biz_noexp_pdp_head_age-1.png)  
    
    *Figure5-2-8: Partial Dependence Plot of Head Age to Conditional
    Treatment Effect*
    
    Same as the scatter plots, the partial dependence plots also show
    somewhat contrasting results. Causal Random Forest indicates that
    as the head age increases, the treatment effect tends to increase,
    while Two-model Approach suggests the opposite. However, both
    methods suggest that there exists an optimal range, which is
    around 35-50. Both methods predicts that households with head age
    around 35-50 tend to have higher conditional treatment effect.

### Women Empowerment Index

```r
target_index <- "women_emp_index_1"

endline1_woemp <- endline1 %>%
  select(everything(),
         -hhid,
         -contains("index"), # exclude all index variables
         target_index)       # add back the target index variable
```

1. Heterogeneity of Treament Effect on Business Index

    ![GATES Women Empowerment
    Index](/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/woemp_gates-1.png)
    
    *Figure5-3-1: Sorted Groups Average Treatment Effects for Women
    Empowerment Index*
    
    The GATES result shows little difference to the treatment effects
    across groups, and the overall average treatment effect is close
    to zero. This might conclude that the treatment effect on women
    empowerment index is homogeneous and the program did no
    significant impact on empowering women. 

    In this case, we could conclude that because of the homogeneity of
    the treatment effect, we cannot find features to target that could
    potentially increase the performance of the microfinance program. 

    However, since the first and the fifth groups are on the edge of
    the significance interval, we thought that it's still worth to
    further investigate since the loan is given to women leading the
    women empowerment index an important target. 

2. The Groups Separating Variables

    ![The Group Separating
    Variables](/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/woemp_varimp-1.png)
    
    *Figure5-3-2: left: Variable Importance predicted by Causal Random
    Forest; right: Vriable Importance predicted by Two-model Approach*
    
    In the case of women empowerment index, the results of variable
    importance produced by the two methods become fairly different
    from each other. In addition, none of the feature is significantly
    more important than the others. One of the reasons of this
    misaligned result could be because the differences between the
    high treatment effect group and the low treatment effect good are
    so small. Hence the two methods start to pick up noisy information
    that are actually not relevant. 

    Nonetheless, we are curious about whether we can still find the
    most efficient value of a given variable in this case. Therefore
    we pick `durables_exp_mo_pc_1`, how much money a household spends
    on durable goods monthly per household member, `hhsize_adj_1`, the
    adjusted household size, `head_age_1`, the age of household head,
    to perform the following analysis. 

3. Durable Goods Expenditures

    ![Scatter Plot
    durables_exp_mo_pc_1](/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/woemp_trend_durables_exp-1.png)
    
    *Figure5-3-3: Scatter Plot of Durable Goods Expenditures on
    Conditional Treatment Effect*
    
    While the Two-model approach shows that higher durable expenses
    lead to higher conditional treatment effect, the result of Causal
    Random Forest shows no significant pattern. 
    
    In addition, notes that Causal Random Forest always predict
    negative treatment effect, which means that our treatment will
    always hurt women’s well being in the area. Therefore we do not
    take the outcome for durables good into an account. 
    
    ![Partial Dependence Plot
    durables_exp_mo_pc_1](/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/woemp_pdp_durables_exp-1.png)  
    
    *Figure5-3-4: Partial Dependence Plot of Durable Goods
    Expenditures to Conditional Treatment Effect*
    
4. Adjusted Household Size

    ![Scatter Plot
    hhsize_adj](/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/woemp_trend_hhsize_adj-1.png)
    
    *Figure5-3-5: Scatter Plot of Adjusted Household Size on
    Conditional Treatment Effect*
    
    ![Partial Dependence Plot
    hhsize_adj](/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/woemp_pdp_hhsize_adj-1.png)  
    
    *Figure5-3-6: Partial Dependence Plot of Adjusted Household Size
    to Conditional Treatment Effect*
    
    The patterns are similar in the two methods and partial dependence
    plots show that households with adjusted household size around 5
    have relatively higher treatment effect. The difference is that
    Two-model approach shows two peaks as Causal Random Forest shows
    only one.

5. Head Age

    ![Scatter Plot
    head_age](/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/woemp_trend_head_age-1.png)
    
    *Figure5-3-7: Scatter Plot of Head Age on Conditional Treatment
    Effect* 
    
    Scatter plots show no significant pattern of how head age
    influence conditional treatment effect.
    
    ![Partial Dependence Plot
    head_age](/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/woemp_pdp_head_age-1.png)  
    
    *Figure5-3-8: Partial Dependence Plot of Head Age to Conditional
    Treatment Effect*

    The results of partial dependence plots show conflicting
    results. While Causal Random Forest predicts that higher head age
    leads higher conditional treatment effect, Two-model Approach
    predicts the contrasting result that households with lower head
    age will have relatively high conditional treatment effect. Again,
    this could be because the treatment effect in this case, on women
    empowerment index, is in fact homogeneous and the two methods are
    trying to solve a nonexistent problem. Hence they produce noisy
    results that cannot be interpreted. 

## Model Comparison

Measuring and comparing the performance of our two methods is not
straightforward as calculating MSE (mean square error) or determining
the accuracy. Since in real life causal inference problems, we do not
have the true treatment effect. Then the above mentioned metrics can
not apply under this circumstance as theyneed to compare the predicted
value with the true value.  
    
Usually the metric used to compare the performances of different
uplift methods is Qini score, where the area under the incremental
gains curve was measured. However, considering the target variables we
selected in this project are continuous instead of binary, Qini score
is not suitable in our case. There are ways to circumvent this
issue. For example we could convert the numeric values into binaries
based on some predefined thresholds that indicate whether or not a
household “really” benefit from the treatment. However, defining the
threshold without further information is problematic in
practice. Hence at the end we did not take this approach. 

The other comparing method is to use the transformed outcomes as
“true” value and calculate the distance of predicted value and the
transformed outcome ([Hitsch & Misra
2008](hitsch2018HeterogeneousTreatmentEffects)). This way the
conventional error measurement, such as mean absolute error (MAE) and
mean square error (MSE), could be implemented to assess the model
performance. For this project we decided to use transformed outcome
approach with mean square error as the error metric when comparing the
performances of the two methods. 

| Methods                                                | &nbsp; &nbsp; Causal Random Forest | &nbsp; &nbsp; Two-model Approach |
| :---                                                   | ---:                               | ---:                             |
| Business Index <br/> (without Expenditures Covariates) | 0.1500734                          | *0.1372834*                      |
| Women Empowerment Index                                | 0.05090984                         | *0.0476428*                      |

<br/>
The results show that Two-model Approach is slightly better performing
in both cases.

## Interpretation And Policy Suggestions

Increase in informal loans decrease the positive treatment effect on
business index, meaning that dealing with informal loans could be a
suggestion to the microcredit institution. Different marketing
strategies can be used and institutions can offer more suitable terms
such as low interest rates on loans. 

The other results related to the businesses were the optimal head age
and household size which had affected more. These are around 5 for the
household size and between 35-50 for the househead age. Besides, the
optimal household size around 5 has also came up significant for the
women empowerment index too. However, it would be a discriminatory
policy to directly implement. Since the Reserve Bank of India
prohibits banks from discriminating against customers on grounds of
gender, age, religion, caste and physical ability while offering
products and services ([Kulkami 2014](#kulkami2014)).

## Conclusions

Both challenges addressed in the motivation part could be undertaken
by the analysis.  

By using uplift models which are Causal Random Forest and Two-model
Approach the incremental effect of a treatment is captured and we
tried to find the heterogeneity between subgroups whose business and
women empowerment indexes are affected by the treatment. As a result,
a clear heterogeneity has been found for the business index, could
have not been found for the women empowerment index. In the case of
Business Index, where heterogeneity is found, the results of two
methods are quite similar in the sense that the important variables
and their critical thresholds are very much alike. However, in the
case of Women Empowerment Index, where heterogeneity is not clear, the
results become very different. By interpreting the most important
variables, which came up from the models and their significant value,
some policies are suggested to microcredit institutions for better
targeting.
