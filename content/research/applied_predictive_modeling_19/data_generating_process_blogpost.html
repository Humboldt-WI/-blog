<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor-link" href="#Introduction">&#182;</a></h2><h3 id="Topic">Topic<a class="anchor-link" href="#Topic">&#182;</a></h3><p>As modern science becomes increasingly data-driven among virtually all fields, it is obligatory to inspect not only how scientists analyze data but also <em>what kind</em> of data is used. Naturally, the performance of a model is bound by the quality of underlying data.
This blog post explores the properties and constituents of realistic data sets and proposes flexible and user-friendly software to support research by means of 'Simulated Data Generating Processes' (SDGP).</p>
<h3 id="Motivation">Motivation<a class="anchor-link" href="#Motivation">&#182;</a></h3><p>With increasing dimension, standard Machine Learning Techniques tend to suffer from the 'Curse of Dimensionality', referring to the phenomenon of data points becoming sparse for constant sample sizes, as well as large parameter spaces which render consistent parameter estimation to be difficult (Chernozhukov).
However, having more and more data available, these problems need to be addressed in a specialized framework.
Another fundamental problem that researchers face is the non-observability of counterfactuals and treatment effects, firstly addressed in the 'Potential Outcomes Framework' (Neyman, Rubin).</p>
<h3 id="Properties">Properties<a class="anchor-link" href="#Properties">&#182;</a></h3><p>The researcher's setting is located in a high-dimensional, partial-linear model.
The covariates are pseudo-randomly generated in such a manner that they are (partially) correlated with the output variable, which itself can take binary, discrete or continuous values. The relation between the covariates and the output variable can be specified as linear, non-linear,(heterogeneous or a mixture // move to treatment effect).
Individual treatment assignment, propensity, being the probability of being in the treatment group, can be random or non-random. One of the fundamental problems researchers face is the non-observability of counterfactuals and treatment effects, firstly addressed in the 'Potential Outcomes Framework' (Neyman, Rubin). In the proposed setting, treatment effects are <em>known</em> and can be customized in their effect.
By proposing a model in which all components are expounded, researchers receive support to evaluate and compare various models that are applied to a realistic data set.</p>

<h3 id="General-Model:-Partial-Linear-Regression">General Model: Partial Linear Regression<a class="anchor-link" href="#General-Model:-Partial-Linear-Regression">&#182;</a></h3><p>The model that our package is based on is a partial linear regression model as it is described in Chernozhukov et al. (2016). It consists of the covariates X that are possibly non-linear in relation to y, the treatment term consisting the treatment effect and the treatment assginment vector and an normally distributed error term.</p>
<p><br/></p>

First, values for Matrix $A$ are drawn from a uniform distribution. In a second step, to make sure that there exist negative correlations and that not all variables are highly correlated with each other, we create an overlay matrix $B$. This overlay matrix $B$ consists of values 1 and -1. Third, we multiply the two matrices element-wise and adjust the result with a correction term to assure that values in $\Sigma$ are not increasing in $k$. This result is represented by the matrix $\Lambda$. In a final step, we calculate $\Sigma$ by multiplying $\Lambda$ with its transposed to assure that it is positive definite.</p>
<p><br/></p>
$$ X_{n*k} \sim N_k(0,\Sigma)$$<p>Where,</p>
<p>$n = Number \; of \; Observations, \quad k =  Number \; of \; Covariates$</p>
<p>$\Sigma = \Lambda*\Lambda^T, \quad \Lambda = \frac{10}{k} (A \circ B), \quad A \sim U(0,1), \quad B \sim Bernoulli(0.5)\;,B \in \{-1,1\}$</p>
<p>$Matrices \; A, \; B, \; and \; \Lambda \; are \; all \; of \; dimension \; k*k$</p>

Depending on the chosen random seed, typically correlations range between -0.7 and 0.7 with slightly varying minimum and maximum values.</p>

<h4 id="Binary-and-categorical-covariates">Binary and categorical covariates<a class="anchor-link" href="#Binary-and-categorical-covariates">&#182;</a></h4><p>Binary and categorical covariates are created by transforming the continuous covariates $X$. Depending on what option is chosen, the package simulates all covariates or a subset of $X$ as binary and/or categorical. The covariates are transformed by min-max-standardization to obtain prediction values. These values are then used to either obtain binary realizations from a Bernoulli distribution or categorical covariates by summing up the realizations of several Bernoulli draws.</p>
$$ p_{j} = \frac{x(j) - min(x(j))}{max(x(j)) - min(x(j))} $$$$ x_{binary}(j) = Bernoulli\left( p_{j} \right) $$$$ x_{categorical}(j) = \sum_{c=1}^{C-1} Bernoulli_c \left( p_{j} \right) $$<p>$x(j) \in X = covariate\; vector, \quad C = number\; of\; categories$</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The following code serves as an example of how binary and categorical covariates are implemented. In this example, the user chooses how many covariates are transformed and gives a list of categories that should be included, e.g. [2,5] for binary and categorical variables with 5 categories.</p>

<h3 id="Treatment-assignment">Treatment assignment<a class="anchor-link" href="#Treatment-assignment">&#182;</a></h3><p>There are two ways treatment can be assigned. The first one is to simulate a random control trial where all observations are assigned treatment with the same probability $m_0$. The second one is assigning treatment in the fashion of an observational study where assignment of treatment depends on covariates $X$ and probability $m_0$ differs between observations. Either way, the assignment vector $D$ is drawn from a Bernoulli distribution with probability $m_0$.</p>
$$ D_{n*1} \sim Bernoulli(m_0) $$<h4 id="Random">Random<a class="anchor-link" href="#Random">&#182;</a></h4><p>In the random assignment case, only an assignment probability $m_0$ has to be chosen which is then used to draw realizations from a Bernoulli distribution to create the assignment vector $D$.</p>
$$ m_0 \in [0,1] $$<h4 id="Dependent-on-covariates">Dependent on covariates<a class="anchor-link" href="#Dependent-on-covariates">&#182;</a></h4><p>To obtain the individual probabilities, as a first step, a subset $Z \subseteq X$  with dimensions $n$ times $l$ is chosen. Then, $Z$ is multiplied with a weight vector $b$, which is made up of values drawn from a uniform distribution, resulting in vector $a$. The standardized version of vector $a$ is then used to draw values from a Normal CDF which eventually serve as assignment probabilities in vector $m_0$. To include some randomness, random noise, drawn from a uniform distribution and labeled as $\eta$, is added to $a$ before the standardization.</p>
<p><br/></p>
$$ m_{0, n*1} = \Phi\left(\frac{a-\hat{\mu}(a)}{\hat{\sigma}(a)}\right) $$<p>Where,</p>
<p>$ a_{n*1} = Z * b + \eta, \quad Z_{n*l} \subseteq X_{n*k}, \quad b_{l*1} \sim U(0,1), \quad  \eta_{n*1} \sim U(0,0.25)$</p>

<h3 id="Treatment-effects">Treatment effects<a class="anchor-link" href="#Treatment-effects">&#182;</a></h3><p>The package offers 6 different options for the treatment effect $\theta_0
$. These effects are: Positive constant, negative constant , positive heterogeneous, negative heterogeneous, no effect, and discrete heterogeneous. When applying these treatment effects, one can choose a single option or pick preferred options and apply a mix of them.</p>
<h4 id="Positive-&amp;-negative-constant-effect">Positive &amp; negative constant effect<a class="anchor-link" href="#Positive-&amp;-negative-constant-effect">&#182;</a></h4><p>In the case of a constant effect, treatment is the same for each individual and, thus, is just a constant $c$. Depending on the chosen sign either positive or negative.</p>
<p><strong>Option 1</strong> positive constant: $$ \theta_0 = c $$</p>
<p><strong>Option 2</strong> negative constant: $$\theta_0 = - \; c$$</p>
<h4 id="Positive-&amp;-negative-continuous-heterogeneous-effect">Positive &amp; negative continuous heterogeneous effect<a class="anchor-link" href="#Positive-&amp;-negative-continuous-heterogeneous-effect">&#182;</a></h4><p>In contrast to the constant effect, for which each observation has the same treatment effect, the continuous heterogeneous effect differs between individuals within a specified interval. Moreover, depends the size of the individual treatment effect on a subset Z of the covariates X. The creation of this treatment effect begins similar to the treatment assignment with taking the dot product of the subset $Z$ and the same weight vector used in the treatment assignment $b$. The result is put into a sinus function and added an normally distributed error term $W$. The result $\gamma$ is then min-max-standardized and adjusted in size with a constant $c$. Note that eventually the size of treatment depends on the intensity chosen which will be explained later on in the application part. In case that the heterogeneous effect is supposed to be partly or entirely negative, the resulting distribution is shifted by the respective quantile value $q_{neg}$ that corresponds to the wanted negative percentage share.</p>
<p><br/></p>
$$\gamma =  sin(Z * b) + W$$$$\theta_0 = \frac{\gamma - min(\gamma)}{max(\gamma) - min(\gamma)}*c - q_{neg}$$<p>Where,</p>
<p>$Z \subseteq X,\quad  b_{k*1} \stackrel{ind.}{\sim} U(0,1), \quad W \stackrel{ind.}{\sim} N(0,1), \quad q_{neg} \in [0,c], \quad c = size \; adjustment \; parameter$</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Tobias-K93/80c8db186625da23d99caebf1bbfc913.js"></script><p>The following histogram shows an example where 30% of the continuous heterogeneous treatment effect is negative and 70% is positive.</p>

<h4 id="No-effect">No effect<a class="anchor-link" href="#No-effect">&#182;</a></h4><p>This option allows that there are cases of treatment assignment that show no effect, i.e. $\theta_0$ is simply 0.</p>
$$\theta_0 = 0$$<h4 id="Discrete-heterogeneous-treatment-effect">Discrete heterogeneous treatment effect<a class="anchor-link" href="#Discrete-heterogeneous-treatment-effect">&#182;</a></h4><p>The discrete heterogeneous treatment effect is created in a similar manner as the continuous version. The scalar product of a subset of the covariates is put into a sinus function and the result is min-max-standardized to serve as probability. In another step, those probabilities are used to draw values from a Bernoulli distribution, where 0's are exchanged with the lower value and 1's with the higher value of the new treatment effect. The resulting treatment effect depends then on at least a subset of the covariates.</p>
$$\gamma =  sin(Z * b)$$$$ p_{dh} = \frac{\gamma - min(\gamma)}{max(\gamma) - min(\gamma)}$$$$ \theta_0 \sim Bernoulli(p_{dh}), \; \theta_0 \in \{0.1*c , 0.2*c\}$$

The treatment part $\theta_0 D $ as explained above, the possibly non-linearly transformed covariates $X$, and the error term $U$. The transformation $g_0()$ consists of two parts. First, the scalar product of $X$ and the weighting vector $b$ is taken. The values of $b$ are drawn from an uneven beta distribution which assures that a few covariates impact the outcome much more than others which seems more realistic than e.g. a uniformly distributed impact. Second, there is either no further transformation, i.e. the relation is linear, a partial non-linear transformation which consists of a linear and non-linear part, or an entirely non-linear transformation. Moreover, the package offers an option to add interaction terms of the form $x_i*x_j$ that are drawn randomly out of $X$ and added into $g_0()$. The number of interaction terms $I$ is set to $\sqrt{k}$ as a default and can be adjusted if wanted.</p>
<p><br/></p>
$$ Y = \theta_0  D + g_0(X)+ U, \quad E[U|X,D] = 0$$<p>where,</p>
<p>$g_0(x) \in  \{x, \; \; 2.5*cos(x)^3 + 0.5*x, \; \; 3*cos(x)^3\}, \qquad x \in \{X_{n*k}*b_{k*1}, \quad X_{n*k}*b_{k*1} + X_{in,n*I}*b_{in,I*1} \},$</p>

<p>The following code snippet shows a slightly simplified version of how the continuous output variable is implemented with the two examples of a simple linear transformation and a non-linear transformation including interaction terms.</p>

The range of the standardized values is set to $[0.1,0.9]$ to assure that treatment effects always have influence on the outcome probability.</p>
