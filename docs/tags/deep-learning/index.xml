Introduction Motivation In 2018, a research paper by Devlin et, al. titled “BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding” took the machine learning world by storm. Pre-trained on massive amounts of text, BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, presented a new type of natural language model.</description>

      <description>Authors: Jakub Kondek, Karim Chennoufi, Kevin Noessler Introduction Motivation The increasing popularity of websites such as Instagram, Facebook or Youtube has lead to an increase in visual data over the last few years. These websites have become part of everyday life for many people and are therefore used excessively. The use of such websites has contributed among other things to enormously increasing amount of visual data in the process. Every day thousands of images and videos are uploaded, making it virtually impossible to analyze them by hand, as the sheer mass of content does not allow it.</description>

      <description>Authors: Gabriel Blumenstock, Yu Fan, Yang Tian Introduction What are generative models? In machine learning, generative models are used to generate new samples following the same distribution of the original data using unsupervised learning algorithms. Such methods provide a powerful way to detect and analyze enormous information of data, which has been applied to various domains, e.g. images and texts. By learning the statistical latent space of images or stories, the models are able to obtain human experiences and then “create” similar meaningful outputs.</description>

      <description>Financial Time Series Predicting with Long Short-Term Memory Authors: Daniel Binsfeld, David Alexander Fradin, Malte Leuschner Introduction Failing to forecast the weather can get us wet in the rain, failing to predict stock prices can cause a loss of money and so can an incorrect prediction of a patient’s medical condition lead to health impairments or to decease. However, relying on multiple information sources, using powerful machines and complex algorithms brought us to a point where the prediction error is as little as it has ever been before.</description>

      <description>Recommendation Systems Authors: Jingyi Liu, Brijesh Nanavati, Bharathi Srinivasan ## **Introduction** The explosion of information with the advent of the Internet and the multitude of choices available to customers introduces complexity in a customer’s decision processes. Recommender system is a useful information-filtering tool, which guides customers to a narrower selection of products and consequently helps them make better decisions. Matching users to the right products saves customers time and effort leading to increased user satisfaction, which in turn earns customer loyalty.</description>

      <description>Neural Networks into Production Authors: Mahdi Bayat, Denis Augusto Pinto Maciel, Roman Proskalovich Motivation Training and tuning machine learning model is a hard task. There are many variables involved that can make or break your results. However, also very important is, after fine tuning your model, to be able to deploy it, so it can be accessed by other researchers, developers and applications.
A very common way to accomplish that is by using an API.</description>

import numpy as np import pandas as pd 2+3 A Gentle Introduction to Neural Network Fundamentals  #### Imagine the following problem: There are handwritten numbers that you want computer to correctly clasify. It would be an easy task for a person but an extremely complicated one for a machine, especially, if you want to use some traditional prediction model, like linear regression. Even though the computer is faster than the human brain in numeric computations, the brain far outperforms the computer in some tasks.</description>
